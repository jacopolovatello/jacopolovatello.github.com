                        <p>I'm currently working as Audio Software Developer at Elias Software, a Stockholm-based startup
                           working with adaptive music and interactive audio for video games.
                           During my previous job at Softube, I researched, designed, and implemented algorithms for audio DSP; 
                           my work there was particularly focused on circuit modeling and virtual analog.</p>

                    <p>Model 84 is Softube's first fully modeled polyphonic synthesizer. This required the 
                       development of new circuit modeling techniques that combined both accuracy and 
                       a limited CPU consumption. Special care has been taken in developing the 
                       original voice allocation modes, in replicating the chorus noise and in emulating 
                       the phasing artifacts characterizing the Unison mode.

                    <p>Model 72 is Softube fully modeled synthesizer. This required the development of new technique 
                       and procedures that weren't previously part of the company's portfolio.
                       Special care has been taken in replicating the feedback around the VCF and VCA used 
                       by many to increase the saturation in the original hardware.

                       the IIR filters, linear phase algorithm and dynamic model. I was also in charge of setting up
                       the main structure of the whole plugin.

                       placed in multiple feedback loops, this required extreme care in the modeling process. The

                       Since the unit processes both analog and digital signals, the project required both the 
                       modeling of the analog circuitry and the emulation of the firmware running in the original hardware. 
                       Moreover, special care has been taken in modeling the AD and DA converters, in order to get the closest 
                       possible emulation.

                       The implementation proved to be non-trivial due to the limitations, both in 
                       memory usage and CPU performance, of the hardware the product is designed to run on.

                <p>Born 1992 in Bergamo, Italy. I live and work in Linköping, Sweden.<p>
                <p>After graduating from Politecnico di Milano (MSc) and Università degli Studi di Milano (BSc), I moved to Sweden and started working for Softube as DSP Developer.
                   There, I designed algorithms for sound synthesis and processing, with a focus on the modeling of analog and mixed-signal electronic circuits.
                   I took the role of tech lead for different products and worked on projects in partnership with Weiss Engineering Ltd., Chandler Limited, Buchla USA and Universal Audio.<p>
                <p>In early 2022, I left Softube and joined Elias Software. There I research, design and implement tools for adaptive music and interactive audio for video games.
                <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time in Swedish forests, lakes, and mountains, and ride my longboard over long distances.<p>
                <p>While studying, I started dipping my toe in electro-acoustic music; I particularly enjoy composing and performing on a modular synthesizer or with a heavily processed electric guitar.<p>
